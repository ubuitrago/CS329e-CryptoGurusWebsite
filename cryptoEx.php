    <div class = 'cryptoEx'>
        <p>A cryptocurrency (or crypto currency) is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses strong cryptography to secure financial transactions, control the creation of additional units, and verify the transfer of assets. Cryptocurrencies use decentralized control as opposed to centralized digital currency and central banking systems.</p>

    <h2>What is a Blockchain?</h2>
    </center>
    <div class = 'cryptoEx'>
    <p>A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data.
    By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data. It is "an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way". For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for inter-node communication and validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires consensus of the network majority. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, blockchains may be considered secure by design. Decentralized consensus has therefore been claimed with a blockchain.</p>

    <h2>Bitcoin</h2>
    </center>
    <div class = 'cryptoEx'>
    <p>Blockchain was invented by a person (or group of people) using the name Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to serve as the public transaction ledger of the cryptocurrency bitcoin. The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto is unknown. The invention of the blockchain for bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the double-spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or central server.
    The currency is based upon a blockchain which contains a public ledger of all the transactions in the Bitcoin network. Those participating in the currency can mine for bitcoins using computer power. The currency had a small initial interest among cryptographers and those seeking to engage in transactions that could not be easily traced.</p>

    <h2>Bitcoin vs. Alternatives</h2>
    </center>
    <div class = 'cryptoEx'>
    <p>Bitcoin was the first of its kind and has the maximum market cap in the Crypto currency world.
    There are more than 2000 virtual currencies in the market as of today and each of them was created with a use different than the other. Few have the same use case with a different approach.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bitcoin has the highest value per unit of any cryptocurrency and accounts for the majority of the market</li>
        <li>Bitcoin has the slowest of the cryptocurrency networks and mainly maintains its dominance because it came first. This is the reason for forks such as bitcoin cash (forks work similar to updates in other software.</li>
        <li>The goal of cryptocurrencies overall is to create a decentralized alternative form of payment</li>

    <h2>Rallys, Crashes and Price Fluctuations</h2>
    </center>
    <div class = 'cryptoEx'>
    <p>Bitcoin has had a very volatile trading history since it was first created in 2009. The digital cryptocurrency has seen a lot of action in its fairly short life. Bitcoins initially traded for next to nothing. The first real price increase occurred in July 2010 when bitcoins went from around $0.0008 to $0.08 for a single coin. The currency has seen some major rallies and crashes since then.
    In the Fall of 2017, the price Bitcoin began to rise .. and rise.. and rise. In October of that year it broke through $5,000, and in November doubled again to $10,000. Then, in December, 2017 the price of one bitcoin reached nearly $20,000. Several commentators and critics called this a price bubble, many making comparisons to the Dutch Tulipmania of the 17th century. Indeed, just a few weeks later, the price Bitcoin fell rapidly, crashing all the way down below $7,000 by April 2018 and below $3,500 by November 2018.
